# Adaptable Human Intention and Trajectory Prediction for Human-Robot Collaboration
We designed a simple card-making task with a goal to make a Baymax birthday card.   
The dataset is available at [here](data/human_kinect.pkl).  
Description of the data is in [here](data/README.md)  

If you want to know experiments and more details of the dataset, please check our paper [Adaptable Human Intention and Trajectory Prediction for Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05089.pdf)  
If you want to know online adaptation algorithms that the data was used, please check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01790.pdf) and [github repo](https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/MEKF_MAME).
